## Reflection 

This project gave me the opportunity to dive into MCP servers, and I genuinely enjoyed researching and learning about how they work and where they fit into modern AI workflows. Through this process, I was able to understand how the full architecture works—from clients to proxies, gateways, and servers—and now I have a clear understanding that allows me to explain these concepts confidently to my peers. Exploring this topic helped me connect technical concepts to real use cases in both my academic work and my professional interests.

Taking the Anthropic Claude courses was especially helpful, because they provided a structured way to understand not just MCP itself, but also how agents and tools interact around it. The prompt engineering skills I developed through those courses have already started to pay off, as they allowed me to break down a completely new concept like MCP into smaller pieces, ask better questions, and then synthesize what I found into something practical.

Through this project, I have begun to see how these skills will support my future career: I was able to dissect documentation, reason about architectural trade-offs, and then apply what I learned to both school assignments and work-related scenarios. In my opinion, MCPs are already very strong for local machines, where the setup is simpler and the security and networking concerns are more contained, and I believe the Docker implementation stands out as the most secure option while also being easier to implement for non-tech-savvy users. However, I also think there is still a gap when it comes to seamless support for remote servers and enterprise-wide deployments, especially around standardized governance, large-scale management, and fully mature patterns for cross-organization use. This gap is exactly where I expect future innovation and my developing skills with MCP and prompt engineering to be most useful. 

*add: after building a custom mcp using prompts and claude. Mention that with very clear instructions and layout Claude still hallucinated with formatting. Installation is a bit more complicated than writing/reading the code. Cross-reference is still required. 
Installation is a bit more complicated, since knowledge of filesystems, config files, authentication is required for installation
