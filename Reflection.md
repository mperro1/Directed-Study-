## Reflection 

This project gave me the opportunity to dive into MCP servers, and I genuinely enjoyed researching and learning about how they work and where they fit into modern AI workflows. Through this process, I was able to understand how the full architecture works from clients clients to proxies, gateways, and servers. And now I have a clear understanding that allows me to explain these concepts confidently to my peers. Exploring this topic helped me connect technical concepts to real use cases in both my academic work and my professional interests.

Taking the Anthropic Claude courses was especially helpful, because they provided a structured way to understand not just MCP itself, but also how agents and tools interact around it. The prompt engineering skills I developed through those courses have already started to pay off, as they allowed me to break down a completely new concept like MCP into smaller pieces, ask better questions, and then synthesize what I found into something practical.

After building a custom MCP server using prompts and Claude's assistance, I also gained firsthand experience with the limitations of LLM support. Even with very clear instructions Claude occasionally hallucinated formatting or inserted unnecessary elements, reminding me that human oversight is essential. Writing and reading the code was straightforward, but the installation phase was definitely moreinvolved. Knowedge of filesystems, how servers work, configuration files, authentication workflows is still necessary to ensure everything works as intended. 

Throughout this project, I have begun to see how these skills will support my future career. I was able to reason about architectural trade-offs, and then apply what I learned to both school assignments and work-related scenarios. From what I’ve seen, MCPs are already really strong for local machine setups since everything is more contained, the networking and security concerns are easier to manage, and the Docker implementation in particular feels both secure and approachable even for users who aren’t super technical. However, the recent React vulnerability CVE-2025-55182 is a good reminder that even widely adopted frameworks can have unexpected security gaps, and it highlights why MCPs still need more rigorous research and hardened best practices as they scale beyond local environments. I believe AI and security teams collaboration is crucial to closing these gaps, ensuring safe innovation, and building systems that can be trusted at scale—and that’s exactly the kind of work I want to contribute to. To me, this intersection is where the most impactful advancements will happen.
